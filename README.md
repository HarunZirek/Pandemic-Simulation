# Pandemic-Simulation
A simulation that explains the importance of using masks during the pandemic by testing them on a living city

This is a senior desing project that made by me and my friend Cem Çakırca. The point in this project showing the importance of using masks during the pandemic by testing them on a living city. To do this we create a little city with people on it. Every people has their specialities. Some has works, some of them uses mask and some of them not, some of them is infected and some of them are not. But all this is selected by user. We try to use randomness to people their job, home, daily routines etc. But at the same time we try to set everything under control. So at the start of the program you just enter the number of the people, how many of them are infected and how many of them using masks. When you start the simulation clock starts and city lives. And every night it shows the results: The casualities, new infected people and recovered peoples. Some weeks in the simulation and result is obvious. The importance of masks...
